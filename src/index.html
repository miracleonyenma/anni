            <h1>Celebrating God's Faithfullness</h1>
            <p>We are so blessed and happy to be a witness to this wonderful work of God! 😇 It was Him from the start. He kept and preserved you for his glory to make manifest in all our lives. 😇</p>

<p>For every thing he has done, we are forever grateful. With joy, the both of you 💑walked a journey that so far took decades to get to where you are now and you're still moving 🙌🏾.  
</p>

<p>As we celebrate 2 decades of his blessings we pray he continues to walk and guide you. 
He says in his word:
<span class="text">Eccl 4:9 </span>It's better to have a partner than go it alone. Share the work, share the wealth. 
 <strong >Lam.3:22</strong>Through the LORD's mercies we are not consumed, Because His compassions fail not.  
 <strong>Lam.3:23</strong>They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness.  
</p>


<p>And as for the lives you've blessed, our lives, we ask he blesses you more ✨. 
<b>Happy anniversary </b>🎉🎊</p>
